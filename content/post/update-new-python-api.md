Thanks to the extensive feedback we have received on our first Python API, we have decided to release some improvements. So in version 0.4.0, we released some breaking changes to the Python API. Whilst these result in smaller applications with less boiler-plate code, it means you will have to update the code for your applications. To alleviate the pain, we created this blog entry to help guide you through the process. We'll be using word count as an example, but you should be able to follow along with your own code. If you have any technical questions that this post didn't answer, or if you have any suggestions, please get in touch at [hello@WallarooLabs.com](mailto:hello@WallarooLabs.com), via [our mailing list](https://groups.io/g/wallaroo) or [our IRC channel](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#wallaroo). And if you're one of the many early adopters that made suggestions on what to improve, this is our way of thanking you for the valuable feedback: we listened!


## What's changed

A few things are now different (we hope you'll agree that this is better):

* We use a lot less "helper" classes, and replaced them with decorators
* You no longer need to create StateBuilder classes
* Header decoding is much simpler

If you want to compare them side by side, here are direct links to the [old API](https://github.com/WallarooLabs/wallaroo/blob/36296bcd583578f5230b6c99e0554afcd3541dc0/examples/python/word_count/word_count.py) and the [new API](https://github.com/WallarooLabs/wallaroo/blob/c346c0427850990af773df4c9f0cf1d56bde402d/examples/python/word_count/word_count.py) versions of word count.

## Update your decoders

Let's proceed in the standard order of what a pipeline would look like. So first, we want to update our decoders to the new API. The new format uses the `@wallaroo.decoder` decorator. So instead of creating a `Decoder` class that implements certain methods, we define a `decode` function (this can have any name), and wrap it with the decorator. We also drop the `header_length()` and `payload_length()` methods, and instead pass a `header_length` and `length_ftm` arguments to the decorator. So

```python
class Decoder(object):
    def header_length(self):
        return 4

    def payload_length(self, bs):
        return struct.unpack(">I", bs)[0]

    def decode(self, bs):
        return bs.decode("utf-8")
```

becomes

```python
@wallaroo.decoder(header_length=4, length_fmt=">I")
def decoder(bs):
    return bs.decode("utf-8")
```

Much prettier, right? That's what we were going for: a simplified API that removes a lot of boilerplate code!

Then, you will need to update your pipeline creation to use the new function instead of the old class:

```python
ab.new_pipeline("Split and Count", wallaroo.TCPSourceConfig(in_host, in_port, Decoder()))
```

becomes

```python
ab.new_pipeline("Split and Count", wallaroo.TCPSourceConfig(in_host, in_port, decoder))
```

## Remove StateBuilders

You know those StateBuilder classes we made you create to that wallaroo could instantiate a new State for you on each partition? They're gone. Instead, when you create the pipeline, you directly pass your state class as an argument to the pipeline creation calls. For example:

```python
ab.to_state_partition(CountWord(), WordTotalsBuilder(), "word totals",
		WordPartitionFunction(), word_partitions)
```

becomes

```python
ab.to_state_partition(count_word, WordTotals, "word totals",
		partition, word_partitions)
```

## State classes stay the same

Your state class does not change. We didn't see any improvements from being able to take *anything* as state. Hooray!

## Update your partition functions (if you have them)

Instead of having to create a partition function object, you can simply declare a function (with any name), and wrapper with the `@wallaroo.partition` decorator. So

```python
class WordPartitionFunction(object):
    def partition(self, data):
        if data[0] >= 'a' and data[0] <= 'z':
          return data[0]
        else:
          return "!"
```

becomes

```python
@wallaroo.partition
def partition(data):
    if data[0] >= 'a' or data[0] <= 'z':
        return data[0]
    else:
        return "!"
```

You will also have to update your `to_state_partition` call to use the new wrapped function (see the previous section).

## Update your computations

This is the biggest of the changes. First of all, a computation is no longer a class. We use a few wrappers to distinguish different computations:

* `computation`: a stateless computation
* `computation_multi`: a stateless computation that outputs multiple messages at once
* `state_computation`: a computation that uses state
* `state_computation_multi`: a state computation that outputs multiple messages at once

You will have to pick the right one to match your type of computation. However, the changes you will have to make after that are all similar to each other. 

```python
class CountWord(object):
    def name(self):
        return "Count Word"

    def compute(self, word, word_totals):
        word_totals.update(word)
        return (word_totals.get_count(word), True)
```

becomes

```python
@wallaroo.state_computation(name="Count Word")
def count_word(word, word_totals):
    word_totals.update(word)
    return (word_totals.get_count(word), True)
```

Notice that the `name()` method is gone completely. Instead, we pass the name of the computation as an argument to the decorator. Also, the name of the function that computes the results can be anything. The only thing that remains to be done is to update the pipeline creation, but replacing all references to the computation class (`CountWord`) to the wrapped function (`count_word`).

## Update your encoders

The very last thing left to do, is to update your sink encoders. As you might have guessed by now, there is a `@wallaroo.decoder` decorator, and we need to wrap our `decode` function in this. So

```python
class Encoder(object):
    def encode(self, data):
        return data.word + " => " + str(data.count) + "\n"
```

becomes

```python
@wallaroo.encoder
def encoder(data):
    return data.word + " => " + str(data.count) + "\n"
```

Then we update our pipeline calls and we are done:

```python
ab.to_sink(wallaroo.TCPSinkConfig(out_host, out_port, Encoder()))
```

becomes

```python
ab.to_sink(wallaroo.TCPSinkConfig(out_host, out_port, encoder))
```

We hope you didn't find the upgrade process too cumbersome, and that the benefits from having a simpler, more pythonic API is going to make using wallaroo even more easy and fun!
